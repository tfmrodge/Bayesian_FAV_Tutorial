# Bayesian_FAV_Tutorial
Tutorial and data from Rodgers et al. (2021) on how to make final adjusted values (FAVs) using the Bayesian harmonization approach developed in that paper. 
To start, use the "part one" jupyter notebook - this will walk through the internal energies and enthalpies. 
The "Part two" notebook walks through the partition coefficients and solubilities.
