# Bayesian_FAV_Tutorial
Tutorial and data from Rodgers et al. (2021) on how to make final adjusted values (FAVs) using the Bayesian harmonization approach developed in that paper. 
To follow the tutorial, use the "FAV Estimation Tutorial - dUs" jupyter notebook to walk through the internal energies and enthalpies. Then, using those internal energies to adjust
the partition coefficients and solubilities to 25Â°C, use the "FAV Estimation Tutorial - K&S" notebook to harmonize the partition coefficients and solubilities. 
Alternatively, each of these notebooks can be used independently to estimate the different properties.
